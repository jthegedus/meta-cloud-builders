## meta-cloud-builder

> Build custom Cloud Build images (builders) from a config file.

Manually build this image into your project once.

```shell
# clone
git clone https://github.com/jthegedus/meta-cloud-builders
# build
gcloud builds submit --config jthegedus/meta-cloud-builders/meta-cloud-builder/cloudbuild.yaml jthegedus/meta-cloud-builders/meta-cloud-builder
# validate
gcloud container images list --filter meta-cloud-builder
```

Create a `.yaml` or `.json` file with repos and the cloud-builder you wish to build into your project:

```yaml
# .cicd/builders/custom-builders.yaml
- repo: https://github.com/jthegedus/meta-cloud-builder
  builders:
    - meta-cloud-builder
    - meta-triggers
- repo: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community
  builders:
    - cancelot
    - cache
```

then pass this config file into the `meta-cloud-builder` step as an arg:

```yaml
# .cicd/builders.cloudbuild.yaml
steps:
  - name: gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/meta-cloud-builder
    id: "build custom cloud build builder(s) from a config file"
    waitFor:
      - "-"
    args:
      - ".cicd/builders/custom-builders.yaml"
      - "--async"
tags:
  - cloud-builders
```

This builder then invokes `gcloud builds submit ...` for cloud-builders defined in the configuration file. You can pass any `gcloud builds submit` flags to the builder except the `--config` and `SOURCE` aspects. [See the flags here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/builds/submit).

<details>
<summary>Automate building your builders with a Trigger</summary>

### Triggers

Now with [Cloud Build Triggers being created via `.yaml` config](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/cloud-build-brings-advanced-cicd-capabilities-to-github) we can run this `builders.cloudbuild.yaml` whenever we make a change to this config file.

```yaml
# .cicd/triggers/builders.trigger.yaml
name: cloud-builders
description: Build custom Cloud Build builders into my gcr project on change
github:
  owner: <org/user_name>
  name: <repo_name>
  push:
    branch: master
filename: .cicd/builders.cloudbuild.yaml
includedFiles:
  - .cicd/builders.cloudbuild.yaml      # the Cloud Build job file
  - .cicd/builders/custom-builders.yaml # the config file
```

For security purposes, I would suggest only running this trigger on pushes to `master` so that changes must be approved before they are applied.

Import the Trigger:

```shell
gcloud beta builds triggers import --source=.cicd/triggers/builders.trigger.yaml
```

### Schedule

WIP: the message-body might need changing to run a GitHub-based Trigger - see this [Cloud Build Issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/142550612).

With custom Cloud Builders you are almost always going to want the latest images from the source. Since we cannot trigger off of changes to external repos, we can at least rebuild these containers on a regular basis, say daily or weekly.

```shell
gcloud scheduler jobs create http \
  build-custom-cloud-builders \
  --description="Build custom cloud-builders on a schedule" \
  --schedule="0 0 * * SUN" \
  --time-zone="AEST"
  --http-method="POST" \
  --uri=https://cloudbuild.googleapis.com/v1/projects/[PROJECTID]/triggers/[TRIGGERID]:run \
  --message-body={"branchName": "master"} \
  --oauth-service-account-email=[EMAIL_ADDRESS]@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
```

Just fill in `PROJECTID`, `TRIGGERID` and create a Service Account and fill in the `EMAIL_ADDRESS` accordingly.

Suggested schedule intervals:
- daily: `0 0 * * *`
- every sunday: `0 0 * * SUN`

</details>

## meta-triggers

> Deploy all your Cloud Build Triggers from config files (`yaml` or `json`).

Pair this builder with a Trigger and have it run on changes to your Trigger config files.

Manually build this image into your project once.

```shell
# clone
git clone https://github.com/jthegedus/meta-cloud-builders
# build
gcloud builds submit --config jthegedus/meta-cloud-builders/meta-triggers/cloudbuild.yaml jthegedus/meta-cloud-builders/meta-triggers
# validate
gcloud container images list --filter meta-triggers
```

The builder runs by recursively checking a directory for files matching a sufix. The defaults are:

- dir: `.` - the repo root
- suffix: `.*\.trigger\.(json|yaml)` - a Grep -E regex

You can override the params, but they are positionaly args so to override the `suffix` you must override the `dir`.

```yaml
# .cicd/apply-triggers.cloudbuild.yaml
steps:
  - name: gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/meta-cloud-builder
    id: "Watch for changes to all Cloud Build Triggers in provided dir"
    waitFor:
      - "-"
    args:
      - ".cicd/"
      - ".*\\.trigger\\.(json|yaml)"
```

Now we want to run this Cloud Build Job any time a file in the `--dir` changes. So we setup this trigger once:

```yaml
# .cicd/triggers/meta-trigger.trigger.yaml
name: meta-trigger
description: "Trigger to apply Triggers on change"
github:
  owner: <org/user_name>
  name: <repo_name>
  push:
    branch: master
filename: .cicd/apply-triggers.cloudbuild.yaml
includedFiles:
  - .cicd/**
```

For security purposes, I would suggest only running this trigger on pushes to `master` so that changes must be approved before they are applied.

> NB: this will perform a `gcloub beta builds triggers import --source=""` of Trigger configs that do not change.

ðŸš¨ Trigger `includedFiles` uses [Go Regex with additions](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/create-manage-triggers#build_trigger), whereas the regex used by meta-triggers is Grep -E Perl regex. Take care.

## Contributing

Contributions of any kind are welcome! Feel free to tackle something from the todo list below.

### Todo

- [ ] meta-triggers: only update triggers that did change by diffing the existing config against the config in files.
- [ ] meta-triggers: fix the [`run-meta-triggers.trigger.yaml`](.cicd/triggers/run-meta-triggers.trigger.yaml) includedFiles regex to include any file in the repo that matches the `*.trigger.(json|yaml)` regex.
- general improvements also welcome, though focus on readability.

### Testing

- meta-cloud-builder: run from the repo root dir to test:

```shell
gcloud builds submit ./meta-cloud-builder/test/ --config=./meta-cloud-builder/test/cloudbuild.yaml
```

- meta-triggers: run from the repo root dir to test:

```shell
gcloud builds submit ./meta-triggers/test/ --config=./meta-triggers/test/cloudbuild.yaml
```
